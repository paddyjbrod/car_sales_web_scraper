# car_sales_web_scraper
Code for scraping carsales.com.au
###  A side project to code a function that takes in a  Toyota vehicle line and scrapes carsales.com.au.
The function will accept an argument in string for such as in the example 'rav4'. It will parse the html and click through any of the pages collecting all USED rav4s for sale by DEALERS in australia. It will return the vehicles model year, model vehicle description, price, kilometers, transmission, and engine in a pandas dataframe that can then be used for further analysis of Machine learning.
